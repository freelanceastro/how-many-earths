		<p id="intro_blurb">Looking up at the night sky, many have wondered how many other planets might be circling those pinpricks of light – some maybe populated by sentient beings gazing back at us.</p>

		<p id="intro_blurb">Today, we are starting to get a handle on the number of roughly Earth-sized worlds that might be suitable for life to emerge.</p>

		<h3>How to spot a planet</h3>
	
		<p>We can take a good guess at the number of alien Earths thanks to NASA's <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/" target= "_blank">Kepler space telescope</a>. It looked for distant worlds by recording the dip in the glow from their parent stars as planets passed in front.</p>

		<h3>In the frame</h3>

		<p>This grid of squares in the northern hemisphere sky, near the constellation Cygnus, was the focus of Kepler's gaze. From its <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126944.700-kepler-telescope-launches-to-hunt-for-alien-earths.html" target="_blank">launch in 2009</a> to the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23550-kepler-telescopes-planethunting-days-crunch-to-a-close.html" target="_blank">end of its active planet-hunting days in May 2013</a>, the telescope's detectors were trained on some 150,000 target stars in this grid.</p>

		<h3>Kepler's haul</h3>

		<p>The green dots are candidate planets discovered in Kepler's data so far.</p>
		
		<p>To pursue our quest, we must exclude planets that are nothing like our home world. First, we will remove everything twice the diameter of Earth or larger, likely to be giant balls of gas.</p>

		<h3>Ripe for life?</h3>

		<p>Not all of the remaining planets will be like our Earth, with life-sustaining liquid water. Kepler could not determine a planet's composition, but it could establish whether a roughly Earth-sized world is orbiting in the habitable zone around its parent star, illustrated below.</p>

		<p>Here is our best estimate for the number of potentially life-bearing worlds among Kepler's planet candidates.</p>
		
		<p>But we are missing much of the picture: most planets remained invisible to Kepler because they never passed between their parent stars and the telescope's vantage point, as shown below. Also, the data analysed so far comes mostly from planets orbiting close to their stars. Others, orbiting farther out around hotter stars, may also lie in the habitable zone.<p>

		<h3>Earths galore</h3>

		<p>After extrapolating for all the missing worlds, Kepler's field of view becomes dense with Earth-sized planets.
			
		<p>Now consider this: Kepler observed just 0.28 per cent of the sky. And the telescope was only able to peer up to 3000 light years away, studying less than a third of the stars in its field of view.<p>

		<h3>The bigger picture</h3>

		<p>Zooming out, the sky fills with potentially life-bearing worlds. The number shown represents our best estimate of the number of these planets in the Milky Way. The view illustrates stars that might host such planets, visible with a good pair of binoculars on a dark night here on Earth.</p>

		<p>Viewed from this perspective, the chances that we're alone in the cosmos seem very slim, indeed. </p>

		<h3>The search continues</h3>

		<p>Even though Kepler's planet-hunting days are over, more discoveries are sure to come as its backlog of data is scrutinised. And the baton will soon be taken up by the <a href="http://www.kavlifoundation.org/science-spotlights/searching-best-and-brightest" target="_blank">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS), <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23359-nasas-next-exoplanet-hunter-to-launch-in-2017.html" target="_blank">scheduled for launch in 2017</a>, which will survey nearby stars across the entire sky</a>.</p>
